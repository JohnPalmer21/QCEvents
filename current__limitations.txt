# Current Limitations

1. Gemini API is simulated, not live.
2. Google Calendar export uses static ICS download, not OAuth.
3. No password reset functionality.
4. No file upload (e.g., images) for events.
5. Mobile app UI not built; web-only interface.
6. Login not functional
7. Events don't repost to database

These may be addressed in future iterations (Sprint 4).
